This is a small game which im working on, and is my first time making to a web project (i.e my first time using JS and HTML). If you have the time, please review it and tell me any optimisations/improvements to my code.
I am coding this on and off, so expect a few days of lots of new things and days of nothing, if you even care.
When I am at the milestone I want to achieve, I will make this into a proper README.md, instead of something I typed very late at night (I'm very tired as of typing this)
